For the rollers:
* 2 x hardwood rollers (80mm diameter, 300mm length)
* 1 x hardwood roller (80mm diameter 115mm length)
* 4 x NEMA 23 stepper motor (M8 shaft if possible)
* M4 T-nuts
* M4 bolts
* 12 x KP000 pillow block bearing, 10mm bore
* 12 x M6 120mm bolt

* 1 x M10 threaded rod 250mm
* 2 x M10 steel rod 450mm
* 1 x M10 steel rod 250mm
* 2 x stainless steel tube 30mm OD, 1.5mm wall thickness, 300mm length
* 1 x stainless steel tube 30mm OD, 1.5mm wall thickness, 120mm length
* 12 x compression spring, 45mm x 9.6mm, 10.4N/mm (or similar, must fit over M6 bolt)
* 6 x M10 flange coupling connector
* Small wood screws
* Flexible shaft coupling, M10 to motor shaft size (motor with M8 shaft is good)

Electronics:
* Arduino Mega
* 4 x TB6600 stepper motor drivers
* Barrel jack connector
* 24V power supply
* 24V to 12V buck converter

## Instructions

Assemble the roller holders.

Ensure the TPU stoppers are well wedged into the steel roller and press further by tightening the lock nuts. The M10 steel shaft goes through the wooden roller, the fit might be quite tight, you may need to hammer it through.
